This folder contains the audioFinder project, an iOS mobile application created in Swift that can find all occurences of a chosen word in an audio file. AudioFinder was a submission to the **2023 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC23)** [Student Swift Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/).

AudioFinder was created and can be run on XCode.

## Implemented technologies
- AV Audio Player (Pause, Play, and Audio Progress Slider)
- SF Speech Recognizer (Speech-To-Text)
- UI Activity Indicator

## UI Design

The app has an introduction screen describing how the idea for audioFinder was born, and the main screen that includes instructions in a ScrollView and the functional audioFinder word search and audio player.
